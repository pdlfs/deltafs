// The following code implements an LRU cache of KV pairs. KV pairs are placed
// in a reference-counted handle. A user-supplied delete function is invoked
// when a handle's reference count is decremented to zero. Both the cache and
// the clients currently holding a handle keep a reference on the handle.
//
// A handle may be referenced only by the cache or only by clients. When a
// handle is only referenced by clients, it is no longer considered "in" the
// cache. A handle is removed from the cache (i.e., from "in" the cache to "out"
// of the cache) when it is evicted by the cache making room for new KV pairs.
// In addition, a client may also explicitly erase a key from a cache.
//
// Each cache keeps two linked lists of KV pair handles. Each live handle (i.e.,
// with one or more references) is in *either* one of the two lists, but
// *never* both. When a handle loses its last reference, it is removed from the
// list currently holding it and then sent to its "deleter".
//
// The two lists are:
//
// * in-use: contains the KV handles that are currently referenced by clients
//     and may or may not be referenced by the cache itself. Items in this list
//     are not kept in any particular order. In addition, items in this list
//     that are also "in" the cache are effectively "pinned" in the cache: they
//     are not considered for automatic eviction by the cache, though clients
//     are still able to erase such items from the cache explicitly. Once
//     erased, they may keep in the "in-use" list until they lose all their
//     external references.
//
// * LRU: contains the KV handles currently only referenced by the cache but
//     not by any client, in LRU order. Items in this list are considered "idle"
//     and candidates for eviction.
//
// KV handles currently "in" the cache are moved between the two lists when they
// acquire or lose their first or last external references. KV handles "out" of
// the cache may only be found in the first list. Note also that as long as a
// KV handle is still "in" the cache, a client may erase it from the cache
// regardless of which list is currently holding the handle.
//
// When KV handles are in the "LRU" list, they are subject to eviction during
// KV insertion and cache pruning operations. Because handles in the "LRU" list
// are only referenced by the cache, they are immediately deleted once evicted.
namespace pdlfs {

// To manage KV pairs, we place KV pairs in handles that are opaque to clients.
// Each handle is represented by a cache entry defined below. Each entry is a
// variable length heap-allocated structure, and is kept in a hash table (for
// fast lookups) as long as the entry is "in" the cache. Each entry is
// additionally put in a circular doubly linked list (either for LRU ordering
// or for sanity checks) as long as the entry is alive.
//
// Each cache entry has an "in_cache" boolean flag indicating whether it is "in"
// the cache. The only ways that this flag can become "False" without causing
// the entry to be passed to its "deleter" are a) via Erase()'ing an entry that
// still has external references, b) via Insert()'ing an entry that causes an
// existing entry with the same key that still has external references to be
// removed from the cache, or c) on destruction of the cache (i.e., on
// ~LRUCache()) when there are still entries with external references. The last
// case is considered problematic as it leaks resources permanently.

//
// * total_usage_: overall capacity consumption covering all cache entries
//     including those no longer "in" the cache. This usage number reflects
//     overall resource footprint for which the cache instance is not fully

// * usage_: capacity consumption of entries "in" the cache. Cache is
//     responsible for keeping this below a specific threshold by evicting

//     "idle" entries, the insertion will be rejected such that the
//     returned cache handle is only referenced by the client but not by
//     the cache: the cache cannot be responsible for its usage.
